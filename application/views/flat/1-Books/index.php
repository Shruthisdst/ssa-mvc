							<h3>About</h3>
							<p>With all the new features in CSS3, we are now able to build image-less websites. In the past, the use of image was inevitable when it comes to showing gradient colors. Today, it becomes much leaner with the use of CSS3 Gradient Background. In previous posts, we have shown you how to bring CSS3 Gradient into play as a background color in various forms and directions; Linear, Elliptical, and Repeating gradients.</p>
							<p>But CSS3 Gradient does not stop only for background use. Did you know that you can also utilize it within borders? Read on to learn how to do this.</p>
							<p>To form the gradient in the box borders, set a solid border on the top and bottom side of the box first. We also create 2 rectangles with 2 pseudo-elements — :before and :after — and specify the width in the same size as the box border width. Position the rectangles on the left and right side of the box and employ linear-gradient through background-image. You can see how this trick turns out below:</p>

								<p class="info">Dhritarashtra said: In the sacred field of righteous activity, in Kurukshetra assembled together eager for war my men &amp; Pandavas, what did they do O Sanjaya. Kuru the common ancestor was blessed by Indra that those who would die in the Kurukshetra in war or in austerities would obtain Heaven. Hence தர்ம க்ஷேத்ர or sacred ground. There Parasurama is stated to have killed the Kshatriyas for 21 generations &amp; offered பித்றி தர்பணம்.<br />
								S.V. Says: &#x201c;In the B.G. the scene is laid on the battle field &amp; the doctrine of intense activity in the midst of eternal (mental) calmness the goal of Vedanta is propounded. (S.V.-P.V.)</p>

								<p class="info">Arjuna said: Those devotees who are thus united to you ever &amp; worship you &amp; those who worship the Imperishable &amp; the Imperceptible Brahman, which of these two are the better &amp; superior in Yoga.</p>
								<p class="info">ஏவம் refers to what was stated in the preceding verse மத்கநம க்றிந்மத்பரமோ மத்பக்த: &mdash; XI-55 i.e. the Karma Yogi who is a பக்த of personal God, the Lord. The other referred to is also the Karma Yogi who is a devotee of the impersonal பரப்ரஹ்மந் without form, the நிர்குண ப்ரஹ்மந். The Lord has originally stated &amp; ப்ரஹ்மார்பண கர்ம. </p>

								<p class="info">Arjuna said: O Janardana, as told by you if புத்தி is considered superior to action, then O Kesava why do you urge me to engage in this terrible action of war.</p>
								<p class="info">Arjuna's question in this verse has arisen on the advice given in தூரேண ஹ்யவரம் கர்ம &mdash; -II-49. Arjuna's doubt amounts to this: if one can make one's புத்தி equable like that of a ஸ்திதப்ரஜ்ஞ it is quite sufficient one can remain quite like a Sankya Sanyasi without performing actions. This is just what Arjuna was prepared to do. Then there is no necessity to wage war &amp; perform actions.</p>

								<p class="info">O Madusudana, how is it &amp; who it is that Adhi-Yagna here in this body. How are you known by the self controled at the time of their death.</p>
								<p class="info">Sri Bhagawan said: That which is the supreme, பரம், higher than anything else &amp; which is imperishable is Brahman. Its indwelling aspect in the created beings is Adhyatma. That aspect which is the cause for the creative activity (for the beings) is called Karma.</p>

								<p class="info">Arjuna said: O Krishna, you speak of renunciation of action &amp; again praise Karma Yoga, the performance of selfless actions. Tell me decisively &amp; definitely which particular one of the two paths leads to ஶ்ரேயஸ்.</p>
								<p class="info">The statement ஸர்வம் கர்மாவிலம் பார்த ஜ்ஞாநே பரிஸமாப்யதே in ஶ்ரேயாத்ரவ்ய மதயாத்ய &mdash; IV-33 &amp; the statement ஜ்ஞாநாக்நி: ஸர்வ கர்மாணி பஸ்மஸாத்குநாதே ததா in the verse யனதயாம் ஸி ஸமித்தோ &mdash; -IV-37 # Su P.-C. likely to be mistaken to mean that after attaining ஜ்ஞாந one need not perform actions in which case the imperative requirement.</p>

								<p class="info">Arjuna said: O Krishna, those who ignore the requirements of the Sastra but still perform sacrifices with faith what would be the nature of their Nishta. Is it Satvic or Rajasic or Tamasic.</p>
								<p class="info">In the last chapter XVI description of two kinds of persons are given, those of தைவ ஸம்பத் who selflessly follow the Karma Yoga Sastra, who are thus useful to the world &amp; there by useful to themselves &amp; those of அஸுர ஸம்பத் who are selfishly inimical to the world &amp; thus inimical to themselves. The reason for the two kinds of differances among men is due to the fact that &#x201c;it is according to every-body's nature&#x201d; ப்ரக்றித்யா நியதா ஸ்வயா stated in காமைஸ்தைஸ்தைர்ப்றித &mdash; VII-20.</p>
